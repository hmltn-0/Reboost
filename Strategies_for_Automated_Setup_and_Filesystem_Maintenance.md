# Strategies for Automated Setup and Filesystem Maintenance

This document provides detailed information on various strategies for automatically setting up a computer and maintaining a clean filesystem.

## Automatically Setting Up a Computer

### Keywords and Concepts
- **Bootstrap Script**: Scripts that automate the initial setup of a new machine. These scripts can include steps for installing software, configuring settings, and copying files.
- **Configuration Management**: Tools and processes for managing the configuration of systems. Examples include Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.
- **Dotfiles**: Personal configuration files for various applications and settings. Managing dotfiles in a version control system (e.g., Git) allows for easy synchronization across multiple systems.
- **Provisioning Tools**: Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Vagrant that help in setting up and configuring environments.
- **System Automation**: General term for automating system setup and maintenance tasks.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Homebrew**: A popular package manager for macOS that can be used to install applications from a script.
- **Git**: Used for version control of configuration files and scripts.
- **Rsync**: A powerful tool for synchronizing files between systems.
- **Ansible**: A configuration management tool that allows for automated provisioning and management of systems.
- **Script Examples**:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/zsh
  
  # Define paths
  CONFIG_DIR="./config"
  DOCS_DIR="./Documents"
  APPS_LIST="./applications.txt"
  
  # 1. Copy Configuration/System Files
  cp -r $CONFIG_DIR/* ~/Library/Preferences/
  
  # 2. Install Applications/Packages
  if command -v brew &> /dev/null
  then
      while read app; do
          brew install "$app"
      done < $APPS_LIST
  else
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      while read app; do
          brew install "$app"
      done < $APPS_LIST
  fi
  
  # 3. Copy Personal Documents
  cp -r $DOCS_DIR/* ~/Documents/
  ```

## Maintaining a Clean Filesystem

### Keywords and Concepts
- **Filesystem Organization**: Best practices for organizing files on your computer.
- **File Cleanup Tools**: Software for cleaning up and organizing files (e.g., `cron` jobs for periodic cleanup).
- **Disk Usage Management**: Monitoring and managing disk space usage.
- **Archiving and Backup Best Practices**: Strategies for backing up and archiving data.
- **Disk Cleaner Tools**: Utilities like `CCleaner`, `BleachBit`, or macOS's built-in storage management tools.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Cron Jobs**: Automate periodic cleanup tasks using cron jobs.
  ```sh
  # Example cron job entry to clean /tmp directory weekly
  0 0 * * 0 /usr/bin/find /tmp -type f -atime +7 -delete
  ```
- **Rsync**: Used for backups and synchronization.
  ```sh
  # Example rsync command to backup home directory to external drive
  rsync -avz ~/ /Volumes/BackupDrive/HomeBackup/
  ```
- **Disk Usage Tools**: Commands and tools like `du`, `df`, and Disk Utility.
  ```sh
  # Check disk usage
  du -sh ~/
  
  # Check free disk space
  df -h
  ```
